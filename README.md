# ðŸ“¦ GitHub Repository Naming Standard
This repository provides a standardized naming convention for organizing coding projects. It helps you (and others) quickly understand the **ownership**, **purpose** and **technical domain** of a repository at a glance.

---

## Naming Format
```
<level1>-<level2>-<level3>_<project-name>
```
- Each level is a **5-letter lowercase abbreviation** separated by hyphens.
- The `<project-name>` is lowercase, hyphen-separated and begins with underscore.
- Example: `persn-infom-miscp_repo-naming-convention`

## Project Name Guidelines

- Use **lowercase letters** only.
- Separate words with **hyphens (`-`)** exclusively; avoid underscores or other special characters.
- Choose a **concise and meaningful** name reflecting the projectâ€™s core focus.
- Example: `chat-service`, `data-pipeline`, `sales-dashboard`

## Best Practices

- Enforce consistent lowercase naming and separation conventions.
- Use this structured naming to aid automation, searching, and filtering.
- Document exceptions or special cases clearly in your project README.
- Maintain this standard as part of onboarding and code review processes.
